# B2B Credit Scoring Platform

**A Complete Step-by-Step Tutorial for Building Enterprise Credit Assessment Rules**

*This tutorial uses only real, implemented features from the Firefly Rule Engine codebase*

---

## 🎯 Tutorial Overview

In this comprehensive tutorial, you'll learn to build a complete B2B credit scoring platform using the Firefly Rule Engine's YAML DSL. We'll create a sophisticated system that evaluates business loan applications by analyzing multiple data sources including:

- **Credit Bureau Data** - Business credit scores and payment history
- **Bank Transaction Analysis** - Cash flow patterns and financial stability  
- **Tax Information** - Revenue verification and tax compliance
- **Business Profile** - Industry risk, years in business, ownership structure
- **Loan Application Details** - Requested amount, purpose, collateral

**Important Note**: All data comes from input variables that have been pre-fetched by your application system. The rule engine focuses on evaluation logic, not data collection.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- How to structure complex rule definitions with multiple sequential rules
- Working with comprehensive input data sets from multiple sources
- Implementing sophisticated scoring algorithms with weighted components
- Using constants for configurable business parameters
- Creating multi-stage evaluation workflows that mirror real-world processes
- Handling data validation and error scenarios gracefully
- Best practices for enterprise-grade rule development

## 🏗️ Step 1: Understanding the Rule Structure

Every Firefly rule follows a consistent structure. Let's start with the basic template:

```yaml
# Required metadata
name: "Rule Name"
description: "What this rule does"
version: "1.0.0"

# Optional metadata for organization
metadata:
  tags: ["credit", "b2b", "scoring"]
  author: "Credit Risk Team"
  category: "Credit Assessment"

# Define input variables (camelCase - from API requests)
inputs:
  - businessId
  - requestedAmount
  - loanPurpose

# Define system constants (UPPER_CASE - from database)
constants:
  - code: MIN_CREDIT_SCORE
    defaultValue: 650
  - code: MAX_DEBT_TO_INCOME_RATIO
    defaultValue: 0.4

# Business logic (choose one approach)
when: [conditions]     # Simple syntax
then: [actions]        # Actions when true
else: [actions]        # Actions when false (optional)

# OR use multiple rules for complex workflows
rules:
  - name: "Sub-rule 1"
    when: [conditions]
    then: [actions]

# Define outputs (snake_case - computed variables)
output:
  credit_score: number
  approval_status: text
  risk_level: text
```

### Key Naming Conventions

The Firefly Rule Engine uses specific naming patterns to automatically determine variable sources:

- **`camelCase`** (e.g., `businessId`, `annualRevenue`) - Input variables from API requests
- **`UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`** (e.g., `MIN_CREDIT_SCORE`) - System constants from database
- **`snake_case`** (e.g., `credit_score`, `risk_level`) - Computed variables created during execution

### Rule Execution Flow

1. **Input Validation** - Check that required inputs are present and valid
2. **Constant Resolution** - Load business parameters from database
3. **Condition Evaluation** - Evaluate `when` conditions or rule conditions
4. **Action Execution** - Execute `then` or `else` actions based on conditions
5. **Output Generation** - Return computed variables as defined in `output` section

## 🏢 Step 2: Defining Our B2B Credit Scoring Inputs

For our B2B credit platform, we need to handle data from multiple sources. Here's our comprehensive input structure based on real-world credit assessment requirements:

```yaml
name: "B2B Credit Scoring Platform"
description: "Comprehensive business credit assessment using multiple data sources"
version: "1.0.0"

metadata:
  tags: ["b2b", "credit-scoring", "business-loans"]
  author: "Credit Risk Engineering Team"
  category: "Business Credit Assessment"

# Input variables from loan application API and external data sources
inputs:
  # Business identification and basic info
  - businessId                    # Unique business identifier
  - businessName                  # Legal business name
  - taxId                        # Federal tax ID (EIN)
  - businessType                 # LLC, Corporation, Partnership, etc.

  - collateralValue            # Value of collateral if offered
  
  # Financial information from application
  - annualRevenue              # Most recent year revenue (self-reported)
  - monthlyRevenue             # Average monthly revenue (self-reported)
  - monthlyExpenses            # Average monthly expenses
  - existingDebt               # Current total debt obligations

  - tradelineCount            # Number of active trade lines
  
  # Banking and transaction data (pre-fetched by application system)
  - avgMonthlyDeposits         # Average monthly deposits (last 12 months)
  - accountAgeMonths           # Age of primary business account in months
  - nsfCount12Months           # NSF/overdraft count in last 12 months

  - netIncome                  # Net income from tax returns
  - taxFilingHistory           # Years of consecutive tax filings
```

### Input Data Sources Explained

**Application Data**: Basic business information and loan details provided directly by the applicant.

**Credit Bureau Data**: Information from business credit reporting agencies like Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Business, or Equifax Business.

**Banking Data**: Transaction analysis and account behavior data from the business's primary bank account.

**Tax Data**: Verified financial information from business tax returns, providing the most reliable revenue and expense data.

This comprehensive input structure ensures we have all the data needed for a thorough credit assessment without making external API calls from within the rule itself.

## 🔧 Step 3: Setting Up Business Constants

Constants allow us to maintain business parameters centrally and adjust them without changing rule logic. This is crucial for enterprise deployments where business rules need to be configurable:

```yaml
# System constants for business rules (stored in database)
constants:
  # Credit score thresholds
  - code: MIN_BUSINESS_CREDIT_SCORE
    defaultValue: 650
  - code: EXCELLENT_CREDIT_THRESHOLD
    defaultValue: 750
  
  # Financial ratio limits
  - code: MAX_DEBT_TO_INCOME_RATIO
    defaultValue: 0.4
  - code: MIN_DEBT_SERVICE_COVERAGE
    defaultValue: 1.25
  - code: MAX_LOAN_TO_VALUE_RATIO
    defaultValue: 0.8
  
  # Business criteria
  - code: MIN_YEARS_IN_BUSINESS
    defaultValue: 2
  - code: MIN_ANNUAL_REVENUE
    defaultValue: 100000
  - code: MAX_LOAN_AMOUNT_UNSECURED
    defaultValue: 250000
  
  # Industry risk multipliers
  - code: HIGH_RISK_INDUSTRY_MULTIPLIER
    defaultValue: 1.5
  - code: LOW_RISK_INDUSTRY_MULTIPLIER
    defaultValue: 0.8
  
  # Scoring weights
  - code: CREDIT_SCORE_WEIGHT
    defaultValue: 0.3
  - code: FINANCIAL_STABILITY_WEIGHT
    defaultValue: 0.25
  - code: BUSINESS_PROFILE_WEIGHT
    defaultValue: 0.25
  - code: CASH_FLOW_WEIGHT
    defaultValue: 0.2
```

### Why Use Constants?

1. **Configurability** - Business rules can be adjusted without code changes
2. **Consistency** - Same thresholds used across all rules
3. **Auditability** - Changes to business parameters are tracked
4. **Testing** - Easy to test different scenarios by adjusting constants
5. **Compliance** - Regulatory requirements can be easily updated

## 🔍 Step 5: Understanding the Multi-Stage Workflow

This comprehensive multi-stage workflow demonstrates several key concepts:

### 🔍 **Stage 1: Data Validation and Preparation**
- **Data validation** using validation operators like `is_positive`, `is_credit_score`, `is_not_empty`
- **Complex boolean logic** combining multiple conditions with `AND`/`OR`
- **Mathematical calculations** for data quality assessment (revenue variance, deposit variance)
- **Variable assignment** using `set` and `calculate` actions
- **Conditional logic** with `if`/`then` statements

### 📊 **Stage 2: Financial Analysis and Ratio Calculations**
- **Financial ratio calculations** including debt-to-income, profit margin, cash flow coverage
- **Risk scoring** with revenue stability and cash flow stability scores
- **Loan-specific metrics** like debt service coverage and estimated payments
- **Bounds checking** using `min()` and `max()` functions

### 🏢 **Stage 3: Business Profile and Industry Risk Assessment**
- **Industry risk assessment** using NAICS codes and risk multipliers
- **Business maturity scoring** based on years in business and owner experience
- **Credit profile evaluation** incorporating payment history and public records
- **String operations** using `starts_with` for industry code classification

### 🎯 **Stage 4: Credit Assessment and Scoring**
- **Weighted scoring algorithm** combining multiple components
- **Industry risk adjustments** and penalty applications
- **Score normalization** ensuring values stay within valid bounds (300-850)
- **Complex mathematical expressions** with proper parentheses usage

### ✅ **Stage 5: Final Decision and Risk Classification**
- **Risk level determination** based on final credit score
- **Approval logic** checking multiple requirement categories
- **Interest rate calculation** based on risk level
- **Comprehensive output generation** with decision factors and summaries

## 🔧 Step 6: Understanding Key DSL Features Used

Our B2B credit scoring rule demonstrates many advanced features of the Firefly Rule Engine:

### ✅ **Data Validation**
```yaml
# Comprehensive input validation
when:
  - businessId is_not_empty
  - requestedAmount is_positive
  - businessCreditScore is_credit_score
  - verifiedAnnualRevenue is_positive
```

**Key Points:**
- Use specific validation operators for different data types
- `is_credit_score` validates scores are in 300-850 range
- `is_positive` ensures numeric values are greater than zero
- `is_not_empty` checks for non-empty strings

### 🧮 **Mathematical Calculations**
```yaml
# Complex financial calculations
- calculate debt_to_income_ratio as monthlyDebtPayments / monthly_revenue_verified
- calculate final_credit_score as max(300, min(850, adjusted_credit_score))
- calculate weighted_score as (creditScore * 0.6) + (incomeScore * 0.4)
```

**Key Points:**
- Standard arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
- Parentheses for operation precedence
- Built-in functions like `max()`, `min()`, `abs()`
- Bounds checking to keep values in valid ranges

### 🔄 **Conditional Logic**
```yaml
# Multi-condition decision making
- if final_credit_score at_least EXCELLENT_CREDIT_THRESHOLD then set risk_level to "LOW"
- if meets_credit_requirements AND meets_financial_requirements then set approval_status to "APPROVED"
```

**Key Points:**
- Use comparison operators like `at_least`, `greater_than`, `equals`
- Combine conditions with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Constants (UPPER_CASE) are automatically resolved from database

### 🏗️ **Complex Boolean Expressions**
```yaml
# Multi-factor validation
- set has_complete_financial_data to (
    monthlyRevenue is_positive AND
    monthlyExpenses is_positive AND
    existingDebt is_not_null AND
    monthlyDebtPayments is_positive
  )
```

**Key Points:**
- Parentheses group complex boolean expressions
- Multi-line expressions for readability
- Boolean results can be stored in variables

## 💡 Step 8: Best Practices and Tips

### 🏗️ **Rule Structure Best Practices**

1. **Use Sequential Rules for Complex Workflows**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Break complex logic into stages
   rules:
     - name: "Data Validation and Preparation"
     - name: "Financial Analysis and Ratio Calculations"
     - name: "Business Profile and Industry Risk Assessment"
     - name: "Credit Assessment and Scoring"
     - name: "Final Decision and Risk Classification"

   # ❌ Avoid: Single massive rule with all logic
   ```

2. **Meaningful Variable Names**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Descriptive names
   - calculate debt_to_income_ratio as monthlyDebt / monthlyIncome
   - set credit_assessment_complete to true

   # ❌ Avoid: Cryptic names
   - calculate dti as md / mi
   - set flag1 to true
   ```

3. **Use Constants for Business Parameters**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Configurable business rules
   - if creditScore at_least MIN_CREDIT_SCORE then set eligible to true

   # ❌ Avoid: Hard-coded values
   - if creditScore at_least 650 then set eligible to true
   ```

### 🔍 **Data Validation Best Practices**

1. **Validate Early and Often**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Validate inputs before processing
   when:
     - businessId is_not_empty
     - requestedAmount is_positive
     - businessCreditScore is_credit_score
   ```

2. **Handle Missing Data Gracefully**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Check existence before using
   - if exists collateralValue then calculate loan_to_value as requestedAmount / collateralValue

   # ❌ Avoid: Assuming data exists
   - calculate loan_to_value as requestedAmount / collateralValue
   ```

3. **Use Appropriate Validation Operators**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Use specific validators
   - ownerCreditScore is_credit_score
   - businessEmail is_email
   - taxId is_ssn
   ```

### 🧮 **Mathematical Calculations Best Practices**

1. **Use Parentheses for Clarity**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Clear operation order
   - calculate weighted_score as (creditScore * 0.6) + (incomeScore * 0.4)

   # ❌ Confusing: Relies on operator precedence
   - calculate weighted_score as creditScore * 0.6 + incomeScore * 0.4
   ```

2. **Protect Against Division by Zero**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Check denominator
   - if monthlyIncome greater_than 0 then calculate dti as monthlyDebt / monthlyIncome

   # ❌ Dangerous: Could cause runtime error
   - calculate dti as monthlyDebt / monthlyIncome
   ```

3. **Use Bounds Checking**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Keep values in valid ranges
   - calculate final_score as max(300, min(850, calculated_score))
   ```

## 🚨 Step 9: Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### ❌ **Common Syntax Errors**

1. **Missing Quotes in String Comparisons**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong: Missing quotes
   - if approval_status equals APPROVED then...

   # ✅ Correct: String values need quotes
   - if approval_status equals "APPROVED" then...
   ```

2. **Incorrect Variable Naming**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong: Using $ prefix (old syntax)
   - calculate ratio as $monthlyDebt / $monthlyIncome

   # ✅ Correct: Plain variable names
   - calculate ratio as monthlyDebt / monthlyIncome
   ```

3. **Missing Action Keywords**
   ```yaml
   # ❌ Wrong: Missing 'set' keyword
   - approval_status to "APPROVED"

   # ✅ Correct: Use proper action syntax
   - set approval_status to "APPROVED"
   ```

### 🔧 **Runtime Issues**

1. **Type Conversion Issues**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Validate data types
   - if creditScore is_number then calculate adjusted_score as creditScore * 1.1
   ```

2. **Null Value Handling**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Good: Check for null values
   - if collateralValue is_not_null then calculate loan_to_value as requestedAmount / collateralValue
   ```

## 🎓 Step 10: Next Steps and Advanced Features

### 🚀 **Advanced Features to Explore**

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   ```yaml
   # Stop execution on critical errors
   - if critical_error_detected then circuit_breaker "Critical validation failed"
   ```

2. **Complex Conditional Syntax**
   ```yaml
   conditions:
     if:
       and:
         - compare: {left: creditScore, operator: "at_least", right: 650}
         - compare: {left: annualIncome, operator: "greater_than", right: 50000}
     then:
       actions:
         - set: {variable: "approval_status", value: "APPROVED"}
   ```

3. **List Operations**
   ```yaml
   # Working with arrays and lists
   - append "HIGH_RISK" to risk_factors
   - remove "TEMPORARY" from account_flags
   ```
